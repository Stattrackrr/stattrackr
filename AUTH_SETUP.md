# StatTrackr Authentication Setup

## âœ… What's Done
- Beautiful login page created at `/login`
- Supabase authentication integrated
- Email/password signup and login
- Google OAuth ready
- Database schema prepared
- Row Level Security (RLS) configured

## ðŸ”§ Setup Required

### 1. Database Setup
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Open the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the entire content from `supabase_schema.sql`
4. Click "Run" to create the bets table and security policies

### 2. Authentication Settings (Optional - for Google OAuth)
1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to Authentication > Providers
2. Enable Google provider
3. Add your Google OAuth credentials:
   - Go to Google Cloud Console
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
   - Set authorized redirect URI to: `https://your-project-id.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
   - Copy Client ID and Secret to Supabase

### 3. Disable Captcha (Required to fix login issues)
1. In Supabase dashboard, go to Authentication > Settings
2. Scroll down to "Security and Captcha"
3. **Disable "Enable Captcha protection"**
4. Click "Save"

### 4. Email Settings (Optional - for better emails)
1. In Supabase dashboard, go to Authentication > Settings
2. Configure SMTP settings for custom email templates
3. Or use the default Supabase emails (they work fine)

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### Login Flow:
1. User visits `/journal` without being logged in
2. Automatically redirected to `/login`
3. User can sign up or sign in with email/password or Google
4. After successful login, redirected to `/journal`
5. All bets are now tied to the authenticated user

### Security:
- Each user can only see their own bets
- Database automatically filters by user ID
- All operations (create, read, update, delete) are secured
- Session management handled by Supabase
