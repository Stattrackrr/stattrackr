# AFL Player Stats: FootyWire vs AFLTables Comparison

Generated by `scripts/compare-afl-stats-sources.js`. No app code was changed.

## Summary

| Source        | URL / API | Game log shape | Ease of use |
|---------------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **FootyWire** | `pg-{team-slug}--{player-slug}?year=YEAR` (basic) or `&advv=Y` (advanced) | One page per player/season; clear table with Description, Date, Opponent, Result + stats | **Simpler**: direct URL if you have team + player name; no index scrape or name matching |
| **AFLTables** | `player-game-logs?season=&player_name=` (our API) → scrapes players index + player page | One page per player (all seasons); we parse game table and filter by season | **Complex**: players index, then candidate URLs, name matching (initials, duplicates), multiple fallbacks |

## FootyWire – Basic stats (21 columns, 25 games in sample)

- **Meta**: Description, Date, Opponent, Result  
- **Stats**: K, HB, D, M, G, B, T, HO, GA, I50, CL, CG, R50, FF, FA, AF, SC  
- **Notes**: Opponent is FootyWire nickname (e.g. Lions, Crows). We already map these in `aflTeamMapping.ts`.

## FootyWire – Advanced stats (`advv=Y`) (19 columns, same 25 games)

- **Meta**: Description, Date, Opponent, Result  
- **Stats**: CP, UP, ED, CM, MI5, 1%, BO, CCL, SCL, SI, MG, TO, ITC, TI5, TOG%  
- **Extra vs basic**: Effective disposals, centre/stoppage clearances, score involvements, metres gained, turnovers, intercepts, tackles inside 50, time on ground %.  
- **Not on basic**: K/HB/D/M/G/B/T/HO etc. are **not** in the advanced table; you need **both** basic and advanced (or only basic) depending on what you show.

## AFLTables (current API) – 30 fields per game

- **Meta**: season, game_number, opponent, round, result, guernsey, match_url  
- **Stats**: kicks, marks, handballs, disposals, goals, behinds, hitouts, tackles, rebounds, inside_50s, clearances, clangers, free_kicks_for/against, brownlow_votes, contested_possessions, uncontested_possessions, contested_marks, marks_inside_50, one_percenters, bounces, goal_assists, percent_played  
- **Only on AFLTables**: guernsey, brownlow_votes, clangers (labelled CG on FootyWire basic), percent_played (similar to TOG%), match_url.

## Stats in both (mapped)

- K/HB/D/M/G/B/T/HO/GA/I50/CL/R50/FF/FA, CP/UP/CM/MI5/1%/BO.  
- FootyWire advanced adds: ED, CCL, SCL, SI, MG, TO, ITC, TI5, TOG%.

## Only on FootyWire

- **Basic**: AF (AFL Fantasy), SC (Supercoach).  
- **Advanced**: ED, CCL, SCL, SI, MG, TO, ITC, TI5, TOG%.

## Only on AFLTables (in our scrape)

- game_number, guernsey, brownlow_votes, match_url, round (we have Description on FW which includes “Round N”).

## Recommendation

- **Switching to FootyWire for player game logs** is viable and **simpler** (one URL per player/season, no index or fuzzy name logic).  
- You get **more stats** if you use **advanced** (MG, SI, TO, CCL/SCL, TOG%, etc.); basic alone is comparable to what we use from AFLTables for core stats.  
- **Caveats**: Need team + player name (or slug) to build `pg-` URL; for “last opponent” / next game we already use FootyWire fixtures and team nicknames, so naming is consistent.  
- **Optional**: Fetch both basic and advanced for the same player/season and merge rows by Description+Date (or round) if you want basic + advanced in one game log.

Run the script again anytime:

```bash
node scripts/compare-afl-stats-sources.js --player="Nick Daicos" --team="Collingwood Magpies" --season=2025
```

Output: `logs/afl-stats-source-comparison-<timestamp>.json` and optional HTML samples in `logs/`.
